# PalmSecure driver

This driver will initialize the PalmSecure, and read images from it.

Remaining to do:

* Correctly detect position of hand and offer advice for better placement
* ability to compare vein-prints

Stuff that works:

* Initialize device with random "encryption" key
* Detect if hand is roughly placed correctly
* Read large or small capture from device
